Hello, I'm Luis.

This is a program written in Python 3.7.9 made to do basic calculations from a starter level physics class. (I was feeling nostalgic.)

Upon startup, the program will ask the user for what variation of the principal velocity formulas they want to use in order to find a specific variable. This will either be v, final velocity, u, initial velocity, a, acceleration, or t, time.

There are four functions (not including the main), that are dedicated to solving for each of these based on the user's input of the other three known values. This simulates a basic calculator's equation function.

Upon successul completion of the equation, the user will be asked if they want to have another equation solved. To exit, the user simply must enter 5.
